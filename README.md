# Clean-Architecture-with-RxSwift-MVVM

RxSwift is the reactive programming library for iOS. It makes it easy to program dynamic apps that respond to data changes and user events inside application .

Why Use It :

Multi-platform
Multi-threading is Simplified
Compassable Components.
Cleaner Code & Architectures
Because you can deal with async problems in an elegant manner. Because you can write better, cleaner code and create components that can be reused in a robust codebase that can evolve.
Downsides :

Learning Process Can Be Quite Intimidating At The Beginning — No Single Article Can Teach You RxSwift
Memory Management Issues — Easy To Create Memory Leaks If You Are Not Careful With Self References Inside Closures
Debugging Could Be Hard Too Considering That Stack Traces Are A Lot Bigger
Final Words :

Choose An Isolated Part of your app And then migrate it to reactive
Best Architecture to support MVVM And MVC
Why Use RxSwift? :

Because you can deal with async problems in an elegant manner. Because you can write better, cleaner code and create components that can be reused in a robust codebase that can evolve. Should you always use it? As any tool, you should use it when if it fits the problem. Consider your team knowledge, context, timeframes and try to make an educated decision. In the long term, I think it’s worth the effort.

Advise ~ Take RxSwift Slow :

Don’t go all in when applying RxSwift to your project. Choose an isolated part of your app, migrate it to reactive, and then weigh the benefits, differences, advantages and disadvantages of this new approach.
